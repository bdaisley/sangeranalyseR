#' Check for secondary peaks in a sangerseq object
#' 
#' This function finds and reports secondary peaks in a sangerseq object. It returns a table of secondary peaks, and optionally saves an annotated chromatogram and a csv file of the peak locations.
#' 
#' @param s a sangerseq s4 object from the sangerseqR package
#' @param ratio the ratio of the height of a secondary peak to a primary peak. Secondary peaks higher than this ratio are annotated. Those below the ratio are not. 
#' @param output.folder If output.folder is NA (the default) no files are written. If a valid folder is provided, two files are written to that folder: a .csv file of the secondary peaks (see description below) and a .pdf file of the chromatogram.
#' @param file.prefix If output.folder is specified, this is the prefix which will be appended to the .csv and the .pdf file. The default is "seq".
#' @param processors The number of processors to use, or NULL (the default) for all available processors
#' 
#' @return A list with two elements:
#'          \enumerate{
#'              \item {secondary.peaks}: a data frame with one row per secondary peak above the ratio, and three columns: "position" is the position of the secondary peak relative to the primary sequence; "primary.basecall" is the primary base call; "secondary.basecall" is the secondary basecall. \cr
#'              \item {read}: the input sangerseq s4 object after having the makeBaseCalls() function from sangerseqR applied to it. This re-calls the primary and secondary bases in the sequence, and resets a lot of the internal data.
