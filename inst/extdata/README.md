This test data was downloaded from http://www.boldsystems.org/ in January 2016

Each folder contains data for one species.
Within the subfolders for the species, each file was renamed for clarity by removing the primer information.

E.g. 
ACHLO006-09[LCO1490_t1,HCO2198_t1]_1_F.ab1

Was renamed to:

ACHLO006-09_1_F.ab1

and then a species id was added to the front to become (this example the species is Allolobophora_chlorotica)

Achl_ACHLO006-09_1_F.ab1


The remaining sequence ID (ACHLO006-09) is searchable on the BOLD link above, and will take you to the original data which you can download.
